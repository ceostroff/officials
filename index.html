Have strong feelings about a policy? Want to take action? The only way to tell your elected officials what you're thinking is to talk to them. Call them, write them.    
</p>
    
<p>
To make it easier for you to engage with your representatives, we've complied a database of the numerous elected officials who represent Alachua County. Feel free to add the contact information for any officials not listed and update old information of any officials currently listed.
